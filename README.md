# CPS2003 (Systems Programming) Assignment

In the [solutions](https://github.com/migueldingli1997/CPS2003-Systems-Programming-Assignment/tree/master/Implementation) folder, use the ``make`` command to compile four programs (server, client, test1, test2). Afterwards:

 - Use ./server (with the required arguments) to run the server.
 - Use ./client (with the required arguments) to run the client.
 - Use ./test1 to run the linked list memory leak tests.
 - Use ./test2 to run the serialization and deserialization tests.

Note that if the arguments are not supplied for the server or client, a message indicates what is expected.
